# New Relic integration for Apache

The New Relic integration for Apache captures critical performance metrics and inventory reported by Apache web server.

Inventory data is obtained using `httpd` command in RedHat family distributions and `apache2ctl` command in Debian family distributions.

Metrics data is obtained by doing HTTP requests to the `/server-status` endpoint, provided by the `mod_status` Apache module.

## Installation and usage

For installation and usage instructions, see our [documentation web site](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/apache-monitoring-integration).

## Building

Golang is required to build the integration. We recommend Golang 1.16 or higher.

After cloning this repository, go to the directory of the Apache integration and build it:

```bash
$ make
```

The command above executes the tests for the Apache integration and builds an executable file called `nri-apache` under the `bin` directory. 

To start the integration, run `nri-apache`:

```bash
$ ./bin/nri-apache
```

If you want to know more about usage of `./bin/nri-apache`, pass the `-help` parameter:

```bash
$ ./bin/nri-apache -help
```


## Testing

To run the tests execute:

```bash
$ make test
```
